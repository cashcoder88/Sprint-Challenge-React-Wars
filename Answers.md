- [x] What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
    - React JS is simply a Javascript library that makes rendering interactive/'react'ive UI much easier than before when devs had to use jquery, etc. React uses JSX syntax, a weird combination of JS and HTML like syntax, to build components, and pass down data.

- [x] What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    - For me, to think in React is to be thinking about your project/app in a hierarchy of components, seeing where your data will need to flow, and what functionality each component will need to have in order for all the pieces of the puzzle to lock together perfectly.

- [x] Describe state.
    - State is an object living in our main components that represents the parts of our app that can change. For example, we could store an array of people in state and display/change/update/etc these people in the app. State is the 'heart' of React apps.
- [x] Describe props.
    - Props, short for properties, are simply pieces of data we can pass around our application. These pieces of data hold the information, the props, that we give them. Props are the 'blood' of React apps.
